        <ul>
            <p> Heres a few reasons why this is happening</p>

    <li>Ukrine Russian War</li>
    <li>Sanctions</li>
    <li> Importing</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>The stop of oil preduction</h2>
    <p>The first few months into 2021 oil has been reaching record highs in history because of the stop all oil preduction in America and now relaying on our enemy Russia to inport oil for us when we could just make it here, save less money on the country and be more independent. Californa reaching highs of 6$ on average per gallon and people are unpleaased and going broke, making them not drive as much and this is happening around the country.</p>

    <h2> Ukrine Russian war</h2>
    <p> With Russia invading Ukrine, Russia is frowned upon everywhere and countrys have set sanctions on Russia causing their ecomany to crumble. Since we buy some of our oil from Russia and we put sanctions on them making our gas prices raise even more in the past few weeks. </p>
